# Gear Planning Simplified (Soon)

The goal of this project is to provide a better UX for assembling and testing gear sets.

The road map is:
- Provide a good UI for making gear sets.
- Allow DPS to be simulated within the same UI, allowing changes to be quickly tested.
- Allow for multiple sims on the same job.
- Eventually, allow for at least partial BiS solving.

This is still in the very early stages, so only a couple jobs are supported.

If you'd like to add jobs or simulations, see [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

You can try it out [here](https://xpdota.github.io/gear-planner/).

Not yet supported:
- Non-healer jobs
- BiS solving
